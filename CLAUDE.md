# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is currently an empty repository named "jpwalk" (based on the initial commit message "p5js-devin-nekonige", it appears to be intended for a p5.js project).

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, no specific setup commands are currently defined. When developing a p5.js project, typical commands might include:

- If using npm: `npm install` to install dependencies
- If using npm: `npm start` or `npm run dev` to run development server
- For simple p5.js projects: Open `index.html` directly in a browser

## Project Structure

The repository is currently empty. For a typical p5.js project, consider this structure:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `sketch.js` - Main p5.js sketch file
- `style.css` - Styling
- `package.json` - If using npm for dependencies

## Notes

- The project name suggests it may be related to "nekonige" (cat escape) based on similar projects in the parent directory
- Consider whether this should be a standalone p5.js project or use a build system
